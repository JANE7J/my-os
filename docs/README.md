# MyOS - Personal Operating System

## Overview
A custom operating system built from scratch in x86 assembly.

## Current Features
- 7 interactive commands (A, B, C, H, I, Q, T)
- Colorful interface with rainbow header
- Beep functionality
- Professional project structure

## Development Status
- âœ… Basic boot sector OS working
- ðŸ”„ Transitioning to multi-stage bootloader
- ðŸ“‹ Planning file system implementation

## Build Instructions
```bash
# Build the OS
./tools/build.sh

# Test in emulator
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=build/kernel.bin

# Test on real hardware (careful!)
sudo dd if=build/kernel.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement multi-stage bootloader
2. Expand kernel beyond 512 bytes
3. Add file system support
4. Improve hardware interaction
